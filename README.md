### 🌱 What I'm Learning

I'm currently deepening my knowledge of the Vulkan API and exploring advanced rendering techniques for culling and mesh shaders. I recently completed the "Getting Started with Slang: Draw Your First Splat" course to further my shading language skills.

### 🎓 Education & Research

* **Integrated Master of Engineering in Electronic & Computer Engineering** - *Technical University of Crete*
    * **Thesis:** *Hybrid and Non-Hybrid Rendering for Diffuse Global Illumination in Real-Time Applications*. This project involved building a real-time renderer and path tracer from scratch, giving me a deep understanding of the entire graphics pipeline. The thesis text can be found [here](https://dias.library.tuc.gr/view/102378?locale=en) and you can also find a small demo video of the hybrid renderer [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc-FNRCIQus).
* I had the opportunity to give an introductory lecture on the **Vulkan API** at my university. You can find the presentation and materials [here](https://github.com/dnikolaidis2/intro-to-low-level-gpu).

### 🥾 Personal Interests

When I'm not in front of a computer, you can find me:

* 🥾 Hiking and backpacking in the great outdoors.
* 🏕️ Camping under the stars.
* 🎲 Enjoying a good board game with friends.
